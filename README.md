# Clinery's homebrew OS
## Architecture
This will be a microkernel with kernel modules loaded in a CPIO initramfs loaded by [bootboot](https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/bootboot)

## Current state
This is very much in development. There isn't even support for the aforementioned kernel modules yet.
There is keyboard support and basic graphics support thanks to [embedded-graphics](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-graphics).
